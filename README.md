# Project Description: House Price Prediction

Title: House Price Prediction

# Overview:

This project utilizes a linear regression model to predict house prices based on key features such as square footage, number of bathrooms, bedrooms, and above-ground area size. By training the model on a cleaned dataset (using the Interquartile Range method to remove outliers), the project provides accurate predictions and helps users estimate house prices based on their inputs.

# Features:

User Inputs: The application allows users to input details about a house, including:
Living area square footage (sqft_living)
Above-ground square footage (sqft_above)
Number of bathrooms (bathrooms)
Number of bedrooms (bedrooms)
Price Prediction:
Based on user inputs, the model predicts the expected price of the house.
Data Cleaning:
The dataset was preprocessed to remove outliers using statistical methods like the Interquartile Range (IQR).
Linear Regression:
A linear regression algorithm was implemented for the prediction model, trained on meaningful features from the dataset.

# Applications:

Real Estate Agents: Quickly estimate house prices to guide buyers and sellers.
Home Buyers: Understand the approximate cost of a house based on its specifications.
Developers/Investors: Analyze property value trends and make informed investment decisions.
Tools and Libraries Used:

#Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib (optional for visualization)

# Future Enhancements:

Integrating more features, such as location, year built, and condition of the house, to improve prediction accuracy.
Deploying the model as a web application for wider accessibility using Flask, FastAPI, or Streamlit.
Adding advanced algorithms like Gradient Boosting or Random Forest for better performance.
Conclusion:
The House Price Prediction project is a practical tool for leveraging machine learning to simplify the complex process of estimating property values. It is scalable and provides a solid foundation for further enhancements in predictive analytics for real estate.
